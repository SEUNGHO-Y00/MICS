# Introduction to Network Security

## Part 1.

1. Speak the lingo
* Vulnerability vs Threat

2. Ethical Hacking Principles

3. Seven-Layer OSI Network Model
   * Application = HTTP/SSH
   * Presentation = SSL/TLS
   * Session = L2TP
   * Transport = TCP/UDP
   * Network = IP/IPSec
   * DataLink = MAC/MACSec
   * Physical Wired/WiFi

## Part 2.

1. Physical Layer - Wired
   * Out of Scope for this class (Cable)
   * What Data Looks like over the wire
   * Hexified for human readability
   * ASCII
  
2. Common physical attacks
   * Network tapping
   * Network interference
   * Bit flipping (EtherOops)
   * Wireless disassociation
   * Wireless encryption attacks
   * Wireless handshake bruteforce
