# Introduction & Framing

## 1.1 Course Introduction

* Supervised learning vs Unsupervised learning

Feature | Supervised Learning | Unsupervised Learning
--- | --- | ---
Data Labels | Labeled data (input-output pairs) | Unlabeled data (no predefined labels)
Objective | Learn a mapping from inputs to outputs | Find patterns and relationships in data
Main Tasks | Classification, Regression | Clustering, Dimensionality Reduction, Anomaly Detection
Training Process | Uses ground truth labels to learn | Learns from structure or distribution of data
Example Use Cases | Spam detection, Fraud detection, Image classification | Customer segmentation, Anomaly detection, Data compression
Evaluation Metrics | Accuracy, Precision, Recall, RMSE, MSE | Silhouette Score, Inertia, Variance Explained

* A Seq2Seq (Sequence-to-Sequence) model is a neural network architecture that transforms one sequence (like a sentence) into another sequence, often used for tasks like machine translation, text summarization, and chatbots. It consists of an encoder and a decoder, where the encoder processes the input sequence and the decoder generates the output sequence.

## 1.2 What Is a Function?


## 1.3 Function Testing

* Applications of ML and data science in security
  - Classification of attacker behavior, access patterns
* Adversarial Machine Learning
* ML used in offensive techniques

## 1.4 Generalization


## 1.5 Machine Learning Framing

* ML + Security
  - Synthactic signature matching fails when you have polymorphic adversaries
  - Bug classes grow exponentially with system complexity, exceeding exhaustive analytical capabilities
  - ML excels at pattern matching anomaly detection, and information mining in complex space

## 1.6 Example 1: Lung Cancer Screening

## 1.7 Example 2: Sports Outcomes

## 1.8 Example 3: Energy Usage
