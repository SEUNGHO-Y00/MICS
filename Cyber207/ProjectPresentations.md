* In 2024, malware stands out as the fastest-growing threat with 41% of enterprises witnessing.
* Human error is the cause of data breaches with 31% of enterprise root causes and 43% of enterprises failing a compliance audit in the past year.

* The malware attempted to escalate privileges and performed malicious actions such as ransomware, spyware, or trojans.

* Hypothesize = Machine learning has improved the ability to offer defense against the most recent, never-before-seen malware.
* This system identifies real-time visibility and context into attacks, showing accuracy to provide real-time detection against a wide range of threats.

* The training phase starts with the collection of benign and malware binaries to be used to train my model.
* This binary file is processed by a feature extractor which I modify.
* Then comes out the training phase, using different algorithms to produce a predictive model.
* The predictive model draws inferences and starts by extracting the features and providing results.

* The dataset is a Malware training detection dataset from Kaggle.
* The main data is classification to describe malware identification.

* To improve the performance and accuracy, use four feature engineering techniques.

* Random Forest model is an ensemble of decision trees that improves accuracy and reduces overfitting by averaging multiple trees.
* The static_prio is the static priority of a process. It means real-time scheduling, particularly under policies.
* It is highly related to malware activities.

* PCA is for transforming the data into a set of orthogonal components that capture the most variance.
* t-SNE is for a non-linear dimensionality reduction technique used to visualize high-dimensional data.

* Two compile errors in TensorFlow Shape mismatch and Data type mismatch.
