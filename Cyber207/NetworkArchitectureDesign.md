# Network Architecture Design

* Agenda
  - Node2vec
  - E2E example = Network attack classification

## Part 1.

* How to apply graph datasets to ML?
  - Each node can be represented with some features related to its relationship with its neighbors

* Node2vec = generating embeddings for graphs
  - an algorithm to generate vector representations of nodes on a graph
